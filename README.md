# Task Manager Application
### /!\ THIS IS A STUDENT PROJECT, IT MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES /!\

## Project Overview

This is a task manager application that allows users to register, log in, create, update, delete, and view tasks. The project is divided into two parts:

- **Backend**: Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- **Frontend**: Built with React Native and Expo.

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file for environment variables**:

   ```sh
   touch .env
   ```

   Add the following variables to the `.env` file:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```sh
   nodemon server.js
   ```

The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup the API's IP address**:

   Add your local IP address into the `api.js` file:

   ```js
   const API_URL = "http://192.168.X.X:3000"; // Your IP address here
   ```

4. **Start the Expo development server**:

   ```sh
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Run the app on your device**:
   - For iOS: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser.
   - For Android: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or browser.
